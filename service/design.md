# Git Repository Code Q&A Service Architecture Design

## 1. Overview

This service provides a REST API for answering questions about Git/GitHub repositories using the Gemini CLI. The service automatically clones repositories, manages local cache, and leverages Gemini-CLI to provide code-based question answering capabilities.

## 2. System Architecture

### 2.1 High-Level Architecture

```
┌─────────────────┐    ┌──────────────────┐    ┌─────────────────┐
│   Client        │───▶│   REST API       │───▶│  Repository     │
│   Application   │    │   Server         │    │  Manager        │
└─────────────────┘    └──────────────────┘    └─────────────────┘
                                │                        │
                                ▼                        ▼
                       ┌──────────────────┐    ┌─────────────────┐
                       │   Gemini CLI     │    │  Local Git      │
                       │   Executor       │    │  Storage        │
                       └──────────────────┘    └─────────────────┘
```

### 2.2 Core Components

1. **API Server**: HTTP REST API endpoint handler
2. **Repository Manager**: Git repository cloning and caching logic
3. **Gemini CLI Executor**: Interface to Gemini CLI execution
4. **Lock Manager**: Concurrent access control for repositories
5. **Cleanup Service**: Background service for repository maintenance
6. **Configuration Manager**: Service configuration management

## 3. API Specification

### 3.1 Endpoint

```
POST /api/v1/ask
```

### 3.2 Request Schema

```json
{
  "repository_url": "string (required)",
  "question": "string (required)", 
  "branch": "string (optional)",
  "timeout": "integer (optional, seconds)"
}
```

### 3.3 Response Schema

#### Success Response
```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "answer": "string",
  "repository": {
    "url": "string",
    "branch": "string",
    "commit_hash": "string"
  },
  "execution_time": "float"
}
```

#### Error Response
```json
{
  "status": "error",
  "error_code": "string",
  "message": "string",
  "details": "object (optional)"
}
```

## 4. Repository Management

### 4.1 Repository Identification

- Generate unique directory names using: `{repo_owner}_{repo_name}_{branch}_{branch_hash}`
- Support both HTTPS and SSH URLs (configurable preference)
- Default branch resolution for repositories without specified branch

### 4.2 Local Storage Structure

```
repositories/
├── github.com_owner_repo_main_abc123/
│   ├── .git/
│   ├── source_code/
│   └── .repo_metadata.json
├── github.com_another_repo_dev_def456/
└── ...
```

### 4.3 Repository Metadata

```json
{
  "url": "https://github.com/owner/repo",
  "branch": "main",
  "last_updated": "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z",
  "last_accessed": "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z",
  "commit_hash": "abc123...",
  "clone_method": "https"
}
```

### 4.4 Metadata Repair and Recovery

The service includes intelligent metadata repair capabilities to handle scenarios where repository directories exist but `.repo_metadata.json` files are missing or corrupted:

#### 4.4.1 Automatic Detection and Repair

- **Detection**: Automatically identifies repositories with missing metadata during `ensureRepository` operations
- **Smart Repair**: Attempts to reconstruct metadata from existing Git repository information
- **Graceful Fallback**: Continues operation even if metadata repair fails, ensuring service availability

#### 4.4.2 Repair Process

1. **Git Information Extraction**: Retrieves current branch, commit hash, and remote URL from existing Git repository
2. **Metadata Reconstruction**: Builds new metadata structure with current timestamp and extracted information
3. **File Generation**: Creates new `.repo_metadata.json` file with reconstructed data
4. **Error Handling**: Logs repair attempts and falls back gracefully on failure

#### 4.4.3 Common Scenarios Handled

- **Process Interruption**: Repositories cloned during system shutdown or container restart
- **Manual Operations**: Hand-copied repository directories without metadata files
- **File Corruption**: Damaged or deleted metadata files due to disk issues
- **Permission Problems**: Metadata files that couldn't be created during initial clone

## 5. Intelligent All Files Management

### 5.1 All Files Mode Configuration

The service supports intelligent control of the `--all_files` flag for Gemini CLI execution through three operational modes:

#### 5.1.1 Mode Types

1. **Always Mode (`"always"`)**: 
   - Always includes `--all_files` flag regardless of repository size
   - Provides maximum context but may hit API token limits for large repositories
   - Suitable for environments with known small repositories

2. **Never Mode (`"never"`)**: 
   - Never includes `--all_files` flag
   - More conservative approach, relies on Gemini's file discovery
   - Suitable for large repositories or token conservation

3. **Auto Mode (`"auto")** (Recommended):
   - Dynamically decides based on repository statistics
   - Uses configurable thresholds for intelligent decision-making
   - Balances context completeness with performance

#### 5.1.2 Auto Mode Decision Logic

```typescript
shouldUseAllFiles = (
  repository.fileCount <= maxFiles && 
  repository.totalSizeMb <= maxSizeMb
)
```

**Default Thresholds**:
- `max_files`: 200 files
- `max_size_mb`: 10 MB

### 5.2 Repository Statistics Collection

#### 5.2.1 SingleRepositoryStats Interface

```typescript
interface SingleRepositoryStats {
  fileCount: number;        // Total number of files
  totalSizeMb: number;      // Total repository size in MB
  codeFileCount: number;    // Number of code files (.js, .ts, .py, etc.)
  largestFileSizeMb: number; // Size of largest file in MB
}
```

#### 5.2.2 Statistics Collection Process

1. **File Enumeration**: Recursively traverse repository directory
2. **Code File Detection**: Identify files with code extensions
3. **Size Calculation**: Calculate individual and total file sizes
4. **Metadata Generation**: Compile statistics for decision-making

#### 5.2.3 Supported Code Extensions

```typescript
['.js', '.ts', '.tsx', '.jsx', '.py', '.java', '.cpp', '.c', '.h', '.hpp',
 '.cs', '.php', '.rb', '.go', '.rs', '.swift', '.kt', '.scala', '.clj',
 '.hs', '.elm', '.dart', '.vue', '.svelte', '.md', '.json', '.yaml', '.yml']
```

### 5.3 Performance Considerations

- **Caching**: Repository statistics are calculated once per request
- **Exclusions**: Ignore common non-code directories (node_modules, .git, etc.)
- **Lazy Computation**: Statistics calculated only when auto mode is enabled
- **Minimal Overhead**: Efficient file system traversal with early termination

## 6. Concurrency Management

### 6.1 Locking Strategy

- Use file-based locking per repository directory
- Read-write lock implementation:
  - Multiple readers allowed simultaneously
  - Exclusive writer access during updates
- Lock timeout mechanism to prevent deadlocks

### 6.2 Lock Implementation

```
repository_locks/
├── github.com_owner_repo_main_abc123.lock
├── github.com_another_repo_dev_def456.lock
└── ...
```

## 7. Data Flow

### 7.1 Request Processing Flow

```
1. Receive API request
2. Validate input parameters
3. Parse and normalize repository URL
4. Generate repository directory identifier
5. Acquire repository lock (read/write)
6. Check repository status:
   - If not exists: Clone repository
   - If exists but stale: Update repository
   - If exists and fresh: Use cached version
   - If exists but missing metadata: Attempt automatic repair
7. Metadata repair (if needed):
   - Extract information from existing Git repository
   - Reconstruct metadata structure
   - Create new .repo_metadata.json file
   - Log repair status and continue gracefully on failure
8. Collect repository statistics (for auto all_files mode)
9. Determine all_files flag usage based on mode and statistics
10. Execute Gemini CLI with appropriate flags
11. Release repository lock
12. Update access timestamp
13. Return response
```

### 7.2 Repository Update Logic

```
1. Acquire write lock
2. Fetch latest changes (git fetch)
3. Check for updates on target branch
4. If updates available:
   - Perform minimal pull (git pull --depth=1)
   - Update metadata timestamp
5. Release write lock
```

## 8. Configuration Management

### 8.1 Configuration File Structure (config.yaml)

```yaml
server:
  host: "0.0.0.0"
  port: 8080
  max_concurrent_requests: 100

gemini:
  model: "gemini-1.5-flash-latest"
  api_timeout: 300
  all_files_mode: "auto"  # "always", "never", "auto"
  auto_all_files_thresholds:
    max_files: 200        # Maximum file count for auto mode
    max_size_mb: 10       # Maximum repository size (MB) for auto mode
  base_prompt: |
    You are a code analysis assistant. Please analyze the provided repository 
    and answer questions about the codebase accurately and concisely.
